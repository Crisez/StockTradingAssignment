# Stock Trading Assignment
OS Course Assignment

(*Important Note: Some of the code for this project was provided for us by the professor to set up the assignment.*) This small assignment had us practice with Threads. We used this to simulate three people trading stock. The concept was to have the traders be able to successfully buy and sell stock around the same time and accurately update pricing information.
